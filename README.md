# Restaurant page

The purpose of this exercise project is to make a functional multi page restaurant homepage using DOM manipulation to dynamically render the entire contents of the website and then use Webpack to bundle the files.

## Build with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla Js
- Webpack

## Acknowledgement

As design reference i used this website [Disco Cheetah](https://www.discocheetah.com/).

## What i learned

- A better understanding of DOM and how to add dynamically content.

- How to create a module and export a function that creates a div element, add the appropriate content and styles to that element and then append it to the DOM.

- A better understanding of how to use the css grid, flex box and how to combine them, adding custom fonts and making a underline animation effect at the content tabs.

- Having my files separated makes the code more maintainable.

- An idea of how to add npm into the project and setup webpack plugins and dependencies.

- Bundle the files and deploy the website.

## Future Improvements

- Responsive Design
- Remake it again using React JS
